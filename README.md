# Evidence-Accumulation
About Here you can find one of the Advance neuroscience projects. In this project, I am going to use Drift Diffusion Model for decision making and a simulation of a simple MT-LIP network.
For the Codes you can connect me through my email. (The codes were removed for teaching purpose)
